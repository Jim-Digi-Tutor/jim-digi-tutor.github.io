    In these activities you will learn about <span class="bold uppercase nc-purple">folders</span> and how to move around a <span class="bold uppercase nc-purple">Folder Structure</span> to find the <span class="bold uppercase nc-purple">Files</span> you need.
  </p>
  
  <p class="page-narrative">
    These activities are completely separate to anything else on your computer, you cannot break anything, so don't worry if you make a mistake, there is no harm done if you do.

    If you want to try a section again, you can use the <span class="bold uppercase nc-purple">next</span> and <span class="bold uppercase nc-purple">previous</span> buttons to go back or forward to it. You can try each section as many times as you like.
